## üîß Functionality
üì±**Main Screen:** The app opens to a main screen where users can input the city name they want to check the weather for or <u>if the user gives a permit it shows the weather in the current location.</u>

üåç**Weather Data Retrieval:** After entering a city name and clicking "Gey weather" the app sends a request to an external weather API to retrieve weather data for the specified city.

‚òÄÔ∏è**Display Weather Information:**
- City name & __*initials of the country*__
- __*Local date & time in the chosen city*__
- Current temperature in degrees Celsius
- Weather description (e.g., "Cloudy," "Sunny," "Rainy")
- Humidity percentage
- Wind speed in meters per second
- Atmospheric pressure in hPa (hectopascal)
- Weather icon corresponding to the current weather conditions
 
‚ö†Ô∏è**Error Handling:** The app handles various types of errors:
- If the specified text isn't a city name, it displays an error message like "City not found."
- If the city's name is specified, but there is no information about the weather in the API, the appropriate message will be displayed.
- If there's an issue with the API or network connectivity, it shows a network error message.
 
‚Ü©Ô∏è**Return to Main Screen:** Users can return to the main screen by clicking the "Back" button.
